# A checklist for task 1 #

## Task 1 A(i) ##
put an x in the box when you are done with that task

- [] Research anything you think is appropriate
- [] Make notes
- [] Submit the notes as an appendix (no idea how)

You should research things like;
- Accessiblity features
- Scalability/Responsiveness (making sure it works on different sized devices)
- Website security
- Different levels of access (i.e. administrators) and access rights
- Guidelines and Regulations you will need to follow

Task A(i) isn't really marked, it's for your benifit. Researching things now will make it easier to put into your document later, and help you think of designs+prototypes.
