when making a dataset, don't just use pie charts
make the questions easy to answer
make the survey quick
anonymous data entry
link response into sheets
you can manipulate your results to back what you are saying
you have pre generated selection of 12 people - make up your own people
non technical and technical audience
select ideas, select statements

e.g. 50 yr old, bad eye sight, need accessibility settings, not electronicaly literate, viewing website on phone

create your datasets so you can copy them out
